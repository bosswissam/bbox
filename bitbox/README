Dependencies:

    bitbox requires python3, python3-dev, libpbc, and pypbc (Python bindings for
    libpbc) to run. python3 and the development headers are easily installed on
    Debian-based systems using aptitude:

        $ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-dev

    If all else fails, the Python source can be found at:

        http://www.python.org/

    The pbc project is hosted by the Applied Crypto Group at Stanford:

        http://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/
        
    PyPBC provides Python bindings for libpbc. It is hosted on Gitorious:
    
        http://gitorious.org/pypbc/

Installation:

    You will need to install libpbc and pypbc before bitbox can run. They are
    included here for your convenience.

        $ sudo make install

    If you want to install libpbc to a directory other than /usr/lib, run
    configure with a different prefix before installing.
    
        $ cd pbc-0.5.11 && ./configure --prefix=DIR_OF_YOUR_CHOICE

Usage:

    Encrypt three files for Alice and Bob.

    $ bitbox encrypt --files file1 file2 file3 --tokens alice bob
